# cvrp-lb1-lb2
Code to compute lower bounds lb1 and lb2 for the CCVRP from the paper "An effective memetic algorithm for the cumulative capacitated vehicle routing problem. Ngueveu, Prins, Calvo (2010), C&amp;OR 37(11)"

Sorry, not enough time to write a proper readme.

Executing the script "script_compileandrun.txt" should compile and run everything
